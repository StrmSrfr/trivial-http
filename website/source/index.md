### What it is {class system-description}

Simple-HTTP is a fork of Trival-HTTP that adds several features and bug fixes and works more the way I'd like it to. Where it's functionality overlaps with Trivial-HTTP, it performs exactly the same.

Simple-HTTP has functions for
* HTTP Get
* HTTP Post
* HTTP Head
* HTTP Resolve - resolve 301 and 302 redirects
* HTTP Download

### Where it is {id downloads}
A [darcs][] repository is available. The darcs command to grad the source code is:
        darcs get http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-containers/asdf-binary-locations/darcs/asdf-binary-locations
       
Simple-HTTP is also [ASDF-installable][asdf-install]. Its CLiki home is right [where][cliki] you'd expect. Finally, there is a also a handy [gzipped][gz] tar file.
